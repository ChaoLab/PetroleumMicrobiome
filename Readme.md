Petroleum reservior MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing (archaeal 16S rRNA gene and prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene)    

MiSeq 16S rRNA gene (archaeal 16S rRNA gene and prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene) sequences of aqueous and oil phases from eight petroleum reservoir samples across China    

The 14 DNAs from aqueous and oil phases of petroleum reservoir samples across China have been extracted and amplified by Arch347F/Arch806R primer pair (for archaeal 16S rRNA gene) and 515F/909R primer pair (for prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene). The corresponding microbial communities of these 14 samples were obtained.    

Arch347F/Arch806R: GYGCASCAGKCGMGAAW/GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT    
515F/909R: GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA/GGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT
